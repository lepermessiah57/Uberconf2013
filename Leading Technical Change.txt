Leading Technical Change
Nathaniel Schutta

Technology doesn't age well!

Old code works, but how much is it costing us?

Don't waste your attention

Go on an information diet, choose two or three items and dig deep.  It must be interesting to keep your attention

You will never do the same thing twice.

Automating, testing, diff

Build canaries, use them

If it is core to your business, build it.
If it is not core, buy it.
Never mix the two.

Always identify cost...
Don't throw good money after bad

Acknowledge the negatives and learn them.

What do you like/don't like about the technology

What would you add to a language, if you had to remove something?

What alternatives are there, and why did you choose the one you did?
Spreadsheets can be beneficial

Harvey(booze) balls are a good visual to map criteria

Book clubs are a great way to introduce technology
Conferences! Push people towards the right conferences with the agendas that are interesting and people will attend

Influence the influencers

Keep a pain register...Track how much time you have to spend to do the jobs
Hard to argue data.

May have to do it the wrong way first

Ask what are the concerns?
Habits are really hard to break

Can't force change, but you can influence.

"Change must happen with people, not to them"

Pushing through the dip

Change takes time

Power of Habit

It is easier to ask forgiveness than get permission - Grace Hopper
