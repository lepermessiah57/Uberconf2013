Integrating Systems Thinking into Enterprise Agile with the Lessons of Lean
Alan Shalloway

"Which part of the airplane is responsible for flight?"
Changing one piece will effect all of the others

Key people working on too many things.....

Delivering value quickly is more important than having all of the features.  It doesn't always work, but generally it is feasable to find some functionality that can be delivered quickly

The majority of features are never or rarely used.
Focusing on the most important features and delivering on those first will prevent many feature waste
Look at time to market, not cost of the time...

Deliver in stages when possible,
Measure the delays with in the process from idea -> approval -> requests -> ... -> code -> ... -> deploy
Easier to reduce delays to improve productivity

Management doesn't understand the technical issues, debt, etc just as the technicals do not see the business requirements
