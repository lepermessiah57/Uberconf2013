Avoiding Over and Under Design
Alan Shalloway

Emergent Design - Alternate Title

Test - the procedure of submitting a statement to such conditions or operations as will lead to its proof or disproof or to its acceptance or rejection.

We look at code and think "Man, I'm glad I'm not maintaining that!"

"We never realize the slow degredation of our code"

Never make your code worse without intending to make it worse.

Recommended the Head First Design Patterns book.

Test First = Design to the public methods of the class
TDD & Design Patterns start on the same point!
