Avoiding Over and Under Design

Emergent Design - Alternate Title

Test - the procedure of submitting a statement to such conditions or operations as will lead to its proof or disproof or to its acceptance or rejection.

"We never realize the slow degredation of our code"

Never make your code worse without intending to make it worse.
